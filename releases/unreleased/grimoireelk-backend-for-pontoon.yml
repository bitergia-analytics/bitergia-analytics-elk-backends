notes: |
  Create new backend to store Pontoon data in OpenSearch.
  The new section for SirMordred is:
  ```
  [pontoon]
  raw_index = pontoon_raw
  enriched_index = pontoon_enriched
  ```
  In the `projects.json` file should be included a URL and a
  locale with the following format:
  ```
  {
    "pontoon": [
      "https://pontoon.example.org es"    
    ]
  }
  ```
